  # Welcome To My Profile
👋 Hi, I’m @scriptSlinger41

👀 I’m interested in coding, software development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.

🌱 I’m currently learning new programming languages, algorithms, and techniques to enhance my skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development, machine learning, or cybersecurity.


⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote a script that generated over a million random cat memes in under an hour!
